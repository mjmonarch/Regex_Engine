  <p>Let's say you are writing tests for a function <code class="language-python">number_between(first, second)</code>, which takes two numbers (<code class="language-python">first</code> &lt; <code class="language-python">second</code>) and returns a random floating-point number between them, exclusively.</p> 
  <p>Below you see a part of the tests. Please type in the answer box the names of the correct assert methods that you would write instead of <code class="language-python">[...]</code> in the code. Separate the first and the second name by a space.</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">def test_number_between(self):
    value = number_between(first, second)

    # which assert methods should be used here? 
    self.[...](value, first)
    self.[...](value, second)</code></pre>
